# Team-Counter
Created a Team Counter that counts points up to 5 and then displays the winner of the contest. Once you reach the Winner Activity, you have three options. A map to show the nearest basketball court, a call button to contact a friend, and a msg button to message your friend who won the game and by how many points they won. I have a video explaining the code and how the app runs.
